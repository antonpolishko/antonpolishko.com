abstract = 'Nucleosomes are the basic elements of DNA chromatin structure. Not only they control DNA packaging but also play a critical role in gene regulation by allowing physical access to transcription factors. In addition to providing the positions of nucleosomes and the occupancy level it is becoming more and more important to resolve possible overlaps, extract additional information about nucleosomes like the probability of placement, and determine whether they are well-positioned or" fuzzy" in the sequenced cell sample.'
